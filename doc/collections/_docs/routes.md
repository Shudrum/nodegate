# Routes

Routes are objects defining the behavior of nodegate for a specific path and method.

_Properties_

| Argument | Type         | Description                                                                                                               |
| :------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| method   | **string**   | **Required.** Method of the route (`get`, `post`, `patch`, â€¦).                                                            |
| path     | **string**   | **Required.** Path of the route, the path can be written the Express way, for example: `/user/:id`                        |
| workflow | **array**    | **Required.** List of the modifiers to apply to the container.                                                            |
| onError  | **function** | Callback to execute in case of error. This callback must return a container object. See [Error handling](#error-handling) |

The pipelines are lists of modifiers to execute **synchronously** to modify the container.

Each modifier of the workflow will be called with two arguments:
 - The container, with the update of the previous modifier,
 - The original request received by nodegate. (The Express request).

## Error handling

Better error management can be achieved with a callback property named `onError`.
This callback will receive a [WorkflowError](api-reference-pipelineerror.md) argument, with the
following contents:

 - The error message,
 - If applicable, the last response received by **nodegate**,
 - The container.

**This callback must return a container object** used by the route executor to send the response to
the client.

In case of error, the statusCode will be set to 500. If a response exists in the error, the status
code will be the same as the response statusCode.

_Examples_

To answer a specific body with the error:

```js
gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/gateway-route',
  workflow: [...],
  onError: (error) => {
    return {
      ...error.container,
      body: {
        reason: 'An unknow error occurred.',
      }
    }:
  };
});
```

To define a specific error code:

```js
gateway.route({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/gateway-route',
  workflow: [...],
  onError: (error) => {
    return {
      ...error.container,
      statusCode: 503,
    }:
  };
});
```
